#This will script will be used to configure a jenkins server on Ubuntu 20.4
# Update Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 The first step is to refresh the APT package repository and install any updates that are available for the system. For all this you just need to run the given command:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
# Install OpenJDK
# Although the user can go for Oracle Java, however, here we are opting for Open source Java supported by Oracle as well as its community. The default OpenJDK version available to install is Java 11.
sudo apt install default-jdk
# Add Jenkins GPG key on Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04
# The packages to install are not available in the default repository of Ubuntu, hence to add its repository first add the GPG key used to sign its packages.
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
#Enable Jenkins repository on Bullseye
#After adding the GPG key successfully, letâ€™s integrate the Jenkins official repository using the command given below.
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
# Run system update
# Once more run the system update command using the APT package manager to refresh the cache and let the system know about the newly added repository.
sudo apt update
# Install Jenkins on Ubuntu 22.04 | 20.04
# Finally, we have configured everything we initially needed to set up Jenkins on our Linux operating system. Now, like other packages use the APT package manager to install it.
sudo apt install jenkins
# Check the Service status
# To confirm the Jenkins is working fine without throwing any error, check its service using the given command:
systemctl status jenkins --no-pager -l
# If the service is not running or active, then you can use this one:
sudo systemctl enable --now jenkins
# Find Jenkins Administrator password
# By default, the setup will assign an Admin password to login to the Jenkins Dashboard for the initial setup, which of course will not require later once we create a new admin user. But initially, we need to find the same using the given command:
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
# Copy the string of numbers in the output.
# Access Web Interface
Open the browser of your local or remote system that can access the domain or IP address of the server where you have installed the Jenkins.
http://server-ip:8080
